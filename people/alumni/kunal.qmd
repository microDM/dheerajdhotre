## About

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I am a Microbiologist and my doctoral research focused on investigating patients with NCGS and IBS for site specific (small intestinal, large intestinal and stool) microbiome differences using multi-omics approach; given the overlapping manifestations of these disorders and lack of genetic and serological biomarkers for NCGS. I also studied effect of gluten free diet on gut microbiome of NCGS patients.
