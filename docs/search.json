    "text": "The microbiome is an integral part of Human Health\n\n\nHuman body harbors microbial cells in 1:1 proportion to human cells and these microbes are involved in host activities including metabolism, immune modulation and production of antimicrobial agents. Imbalance in microbial communities associated with the host has been observed in multiple diseases as well as metabolic disorders.\nIn the DDOmics Lab, we study microbial community structure and function in human health and diseases using classic microbiology techniques, next generation sequencing and multi-omics data integration approach. Our areas of focus are Mcirobiome of Indian healthy communities, Microbiome of gluten spectrum disorders, Mother and infant microbiome, Gut-brain axis, and Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe lab is located at National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) inside Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) campus in the city of Pune\n\n\n\nOur laboratory is funded by Department of Biotechnology, Department of Science and Technology and Science and Engineering Research Board, New Delhi.\n                       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nDr. Dhiraj S.

    "text": "Indian human microbiome initiative\n\nIndian human microbiome initiative (IHMI) is a flagship project of NCCS, Pune and DBT, Government of India. The first phase of this study looks into the gut and oral cavity microbiome of 3400 individuals from 17 endogamous populations spread across the country using targeted amplicon and metagenomic sequencing data; followed by 20,000 individuals in the next phase. Aim of the project is to generate comprehensive dietary and baseline microbiome map of India for comparative analysis which can be further used for multiple aspects of microbiome-based studies in human health, disease and therapies. The project works in parallel with another study looking into genotyping data generated from same individuals which will help to correlate two datasets."
